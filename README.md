### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am [Manish Sharma](https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish-sharma-19636b51/), a passionate engineer by proffession and a fun loving person by nature. Always keen to learn new technologies and in my 8+ years of experience I have developed more more than 100 of android applications like utility apps, apps which can edit/trim videos, apps for image editing, voice changer, etc. Used open source codes and optimised them for much better performance and features for browsers and video players. I have developed iOs and Windows library for developers so that they can monetize their apps by using that library, tried backend services using Node js, python using database like MySQL and MongoDB. Have experience in SEO, SEM, Google analytics and Firebase tools.

Other than tech related stuff I am trying my hands on Youtube for vlogging and learning Adobe tools for creating Character, Animator for animating and photoshop for editing images. Getting my hands on video editing tools for editing videos and background music and then published few videos on my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdLOBpInqnohlIAqQLgNlUQ). 

I have a page on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/AndroidFreeAppPage) with more than 1k followers where I create and share funny memes and videos. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementation of CI-CD in android and iOs apps using Fastlane. And using Firebase for an end to end deployment of microservices on its serverless architecture and using firebase tools for realtime database, Firestore database along with Analytics and Crashlytics in android app.
